# Repeat Buyer Prediction for E-Commerce 🛒📊

This project aims to predict repeat buyers for e-commerce platforms using a novel hybrid recommendation system. By combining **Deep Neural Network (DNN) embeddings** with **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, the system identifies similar customers in embedding space, achieving **96% accuracy** on Alibaba’s dataset. The solution directly aids in improving e-commerce marketing strategies and customer retention.
