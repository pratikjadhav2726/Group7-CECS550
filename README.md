Merchants often gain many new customers through promotions, but a significant portion of these customers are only interested in one-time deals. Therefore, the impact of promotions on long-term sales may be limited. To maximize return on investment (ROI) and reduce promotion costs, it is crucial for merchants to distinguish between one-time buyers and potential loyal customers and focus their efforts on converting the latter group.

In this project, you are provided a dataset with information on promotional shopping event from e-commerce platform. Your task is to design a system which will increase the ROI (in other words, you need to predict the probability that these new buyers would purchase items from the same merchants again within 6 months), reduce promotional cost, and identify one-time buyers.
